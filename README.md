Age matters in fertility â€” especially for women. After age 35, the egg quality and quantity start dropping. After 40, it drops even more. At Ayuh Fertility Centre, they treat many women in their late 30s and even 40s who are trying to conceive.

Dr. Krupa Shah starts with a simple AMH blood test and ultrasound to check the womanâ€™s egg reserve. If chances are fair, she recommends IVF using the womanâ€™s own eggs. But if egg count is very low, donor egg IVF may be suggested â€” always after discussing everything openly.

Ayuh also monitors older women more closely during pregnancy because risks can be slightly higher â€” like blood pressure or gestational diabetes.
